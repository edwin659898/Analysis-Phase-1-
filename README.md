## 📊 Overview

This project involves the analysis of aviation incident and accident data using Python (Pandas), Tableau, and Google Colab. It explores trends, patterns, and insights that can guide decision-making and business recommendations in the aviation sector.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and prepare aviation incident data.
- Identify trends and relationships across factors such as time, country, aircraft damage, and injury severity.
- Use effective visualizations to communicate insights.
- Generate actionable business recommendations.
- Create an interactive dashboard for exploration.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **Google Colab** – for collaborative, browser-based execution
- **Tableau** – for dashboard creation and advanced visuals
- **Jupyter Notebook** – structured and well-documented analysis

## 📂 Dataset

- **File**: `AviationData.csv`
- **Source**: Uploaded CSV file containing historical aviation incidents
- **Encoding Note**: The file is encoded in `latin1` to avoid decoding errors in Colab.

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1. Upload the CSV file

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
